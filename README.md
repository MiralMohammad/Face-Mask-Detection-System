# Face Mask Detection Using Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning–based computer vision system to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. 
The model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images into two categories: **Mask** and **No Mask**.

## 📌 Project Overview
Face mask detection is an important application of computer vision in public health and safety systems. 
This project demonstrates how image preprocessing and deep learning techniques can be applied to automatically detect face mask usage from images.

## 🧠 Methodology
The project follows a standard deep learning pipeline:
- Image data loading and preprocessing
- Data normalization and resizing
- CNN model design and training
- Model evaluation on test data
- Prediction and visualization of results

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled images of faces with and without masks. Images are preprocessed and resized before being fed into the CNN model for training and evaluation.

## 🚀 Results
The trained CNN model successfully learned to distinguish between masked and unmasked faces, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning techniques in image classification tasks.
